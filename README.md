# Flashcards - React Native - App

I tried to recreate a MVP of the popular flashcard app Anki using React Native and Redux. I've always found Anki very useful for language learning and recoding the logic in React Native was a fun project.

## Tech Stack

- React Native (Expo)
- Redux

## Plans for the future

Create an Electron-React equivalent for the Desktop and sync them.
